# Black Paper Coin: A Decentralized Cryptocurrency Based on the Korean Kim Pattern

## Abstract

We propose a new decentralized cryptocurrency called Black Paper Coin that builds upon the pioneering work of Bitcoin while incorporating novel elements inspired by the Korean Kim Pattern. Black Paper Coin utilizes a peer-to-peer network to record a public ledger of transactions using a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. However, instead of mining based solely on computational power, Black Paper Coin mining incorporates a unique algorithm derived from the Kim Pattern principles of balance, symmetry, and harmony. This provides a more egalitarian mining process compared to Bitcoin's resource-intensive proof-of-work.

## Introduction

Bitcoin's key innovations were introducing a decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash system and solving the double-spend problem without a trusted third party. However, Bitcoin's proof-of-work mining process based on CPU power leads to a computationally wasteful arms race and concentrates mining among those with access to specialized hardware.  

We propose Black Paper Coin as an alternative cryptocurrency design that aims to promote greater decentralization and even distribution initially, while still maintaining a secure and robust blockchain network.

Black Paper Coin integrates core Bitcoin elements like a public transaction ledger, peer-to-peer networking, and proof-of-work consensus. However, it replaces Bitcoin's computationally-intensive hash-based mining with a novel proof-of-work algorithm inspired by the Korean Kim Pattern design principles.

## Kim Pattern Proof-of-Work

The Kim Pattern is a traditional Korean decorative art form dating back to the Three Kingdoms era, based on principles of balance, symmetry, and harmonious repetition. Rather than mining by brute-force computation of random hashes, Black Paper Coin miners compete to solve Kim Pattern-derived proof-of-work puzzles that require finding aesthetically pleasing and harmonious pattern arrangements.

The mining algorithm generates target Kim Patterns with specific aesthetic rules based on symmetry, balance of colors/shapes, and seamless repetition. Miners propose candidate solutions that are evaluated against these target patterns using a deterministic scoring function that captures the principles of visual harmony and equilibrium.  

The miner proposing the most harmonious and aesthetically valid Kim Pattern solution that meets the target's difficulty criteria wins that round and receives the block reward. This Kim Pattern proof-of-work nicely aligns computational effort with the creation of value in the form of aesthetically pleasing visual patterns.

By leveraging human creativity and visual/spatial skills rather than brute computation, Kim Pattern mining makes the mining process more egalitarian compared to hardware-centric Bitcoin mining. It potentially allows a wider pool of participants without specialized equipment.

The rest of the protocol works similarly to Bitcoin, with miners bundling transactions into blocks, chaining the blocks in a public immutable ledger ordered by proof-of-work, dynamic difficulty adjustment, coinbase incentives declining over time, and so on.

## Conclusion

Black Paper Coin proposes an innovative alternative to traditional hashcash proof-of-work by deriving its mining process from the artistic patterns and visual principles of the Korean Kim Pattern tradition. This promotes a more equitable and decentralized distribution compared to hardware-driven Bitcoin mining. At the same time, it maintains core cryptocurrency benefits like a public distributed transaction ledger, pseudo-anonymity, and verifiable scarcity without a central authority. Black Paper Coin aims to be a novel marriage of ancient visual arts, modern cryptocurrency principles, and an egalitarian ethos.
